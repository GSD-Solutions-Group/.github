 # Project Description

In this project we are providing a proposal for a small space startup that includes the following aspects and provides solutions for the client:
- Technological Requirements: 
     - User provisioning to set up a single endpoint by connecting users to network resources. 
     - A backup solution that preserves data. 
     - Operating system diversity by incorporating both Windows and Linux systems. 
     - Creating an email client to connect users to their email and share files based on roles. 
     - Enable remote access to establish a secure technology and protocols for remote access.


- Company Requirements: 
     - Expansion for technical and non technical roles with occasional travel. 
     - Information security is a top priority, as their intellectual property is their primary asset; 
     - Restricts the movement of intellectual property.
